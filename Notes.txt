This version utilizes multiple pages to simplify display of information. In addition, preferences are now created
and stored for individual users locally using XML files generated based on inputted user data. With preferences
comes profiles, so users will be asked to create (right now basic) profile information.
 - How can these be stored in a webpage that uses Google Sites? What is Google Sites cookie functionality. 

Preferences are handled by the handler.js script. plannerApplet.js still contains the same functions, but will now
be accessed from different HTML pages, and has been renamed to planner.js.

Improvements to style can be made as well.
